            ## Defining Functions

            ---

            ### Function Statement
            Also referred to as a function declaration, this is a classic syntax common to many languages.

            ```js
            function greet() {
              console.log('Hi!');
            }
            ```

            ---

            ### Function Expression
            Javascript also supports function expressions, which returns the function as a value which can then be assigned to a variable using the assignment operator `=`

            ```js
            const greet = function() {
              console.log('Hi!');
            };
            ```

            ---
            
            ### ES6 Fat Arrow Syntax
            In June 2015, a new version of Javascript (ES6) was released and added a new "fat arrow" syntax for declaring functions. You will often see this syntax in documentation:

            ```js
            const greet = () => {
              console.log('Hi!');
            }
            ```

            ---

            ### Key Takeaways
            - Code inside a function does not execute at the time of declaration. You have to invoke a function later to run the code inside it.

            ---

            ## Invoking Functions
            Once a function has been defined, it an be invoked/called/run. It's important to understand that the definition of a function (where the code inside the function is not run) is different than running a function.

            ---

            ### Functions Values vs Invocation
            It's important to recognize when a function is being passed as a value or if it's being invoked.

            ---

            ### Functions as values
            Javascript is one of the few languages that can treat functions as values. This leads to odd syntax, but recognizing the parentheses () helps demystify things.

            If a named function is written without parentheses:

            ```js
            console.log(greet); // "function"
            ```

            it's being passed as a value just like any other value (i.e. a string, number, etc) would be.

            ---

            ### Invoked Function
            If a named function includes trailing parentheses (`greet()`), then the function is being invoked (in other words, you are running or calling the function):

            ```js
            console.log(greet()); // "Hi!"
            ```

            ---

            ## Parameters vs Arguments


            ---

            A function defined without parameters:

            ```js
            const greet = function() {
              console.log("Hi!");
            }
            ```

            Is invoked without arguments:

            ```js
            greet(); // Hi!
            ```

            ---

            A function defined with a parameter:

            ```js
            const greet = function(name) {
              console.log(`Hi, ${name}!`);
            }
            ```

            Is invoked with one or more arguments (optionally):

            ```js
            greet('Tony'); // Hi, Tony!
            ```

            ---

            A function declared using ES6 arrow syntax:

            ```js
            const greet = (name) => {
              console.log(`Hi, ${name}!`);
            }
            ```

            In ES6 allows for optional default values for a parameter (works with non-arrow functions too).

            ```js
            const greet = (name = 'Pal') => {
              console.log(`Hi, ${name}!`);
            }
            ```

            If name is not passed to the function, it will default to Pal:

            ```js
            greet(); // Hi, Pal!
            ```
            
            ---

            ### Key Takeaways
            - Parameters and arguments are often confused. You pass _arguments_ to a function after you define the function's _parameters_.
            - Javascript (by default) won't complain if you don't pass an argument when a parameter is defined.

            ---
            
            ## Return Values
            Functions can (optionally) return values when invoked if they contain the `return` keyword.

            ---

            If a function doesn't have a `return` keyword, it returns `undefined`:

            ```js
            const greet = function() {
              // empty function, but code might exist
            }
            
            const greeting = greet(); // undefined
            ```

            ---

            Otherwise, they can return a specific value:

            ```js
            const greet = function() {
              return 'Hi!';
            }
            
            const greeting = greet(); // "Hi!"
            ```

            ---
            
            ### Key Takeaways
            - Functions don't need to return a value to be useful. You can do many other things such as (for example) set/change global variables, access a database or fetch data from an endpoint.

            ```js
            const redirect = function() {
              window.location('https://www.google.com');
            }
            ```
